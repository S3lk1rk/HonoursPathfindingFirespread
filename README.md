# HonoursPathfindingFirespread

This code belongs to matthew selkirk and will be used for the purposes of his honours project

## ðŸ§¬ Purpose of the application
The purpose of this application was to prove the hypothesis
"An application that employs pathfinding algorithms to navigate users from a designated start to an end point in a realistic building scenario, while avoiding blocked areas, fire hazards, and dynamically adjusting the route based on real-time fire spread, will demonstrate the potential for improving existing fire evacuation tools and successfully guide users to safety during an evacuation."

Primary objectives
- [x] Develop interactive grid application.
- [x] Create and integrate pathfinding tools.
- [x] Prototype movement and integrate fire spread.
- [x] Update the user interface for final implementation.
- [x] Testing

### ðŸ’¾ `Local installation` 
- When the application zip file has been downloaded, extract it and open with visual code studio.

- Next install pygame using this command

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

- Or follow the steps on the [pygame website](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) if you cannot download it via that method.

## ðŸ”¨ Future work
When the level of expertise with electrical engineering is achieved to implement this into a real world solution a sensor network composed of low energy bluetooth sensors and the necessary fire detection sensors will be integrated to provide real world data to the pathfinding program.
